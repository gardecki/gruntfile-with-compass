# gruntfile-with-compass
This is my basic initial "frontend seed" with npm, bower and grunt files.

## General Requirements
First of all you have to install few things:

1. <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank">node</a>
2. [bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower)
3. [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt)
4. You also have to install [compass](http://thesassway.com/beginner/getting-started-with-sass-and-compass) in order to run grunt-contrib-compass task used in this gruntfile.  

##How it works?
